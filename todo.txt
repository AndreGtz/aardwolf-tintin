Development ToDo List

Improve the installation and setup phase.
	- installation script
	- optional install of tintin/tmux
	- basic map with some newbie areas mapped

Provide some in-game (in-client) commands for help/docs and control.
	- map control
	- map custom exits, portals, speedwalking (paths.tin)
	- channel gagging

Add more commenting to the settings.

Separate the "core" components from the "plug-ins"
	- .tin vs .tt and/or directories

Remove redundancy, fix bugs, add functionality to settings.
